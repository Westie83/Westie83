- 👋 Hi, I’m @Westie83
- 👀 I’m interested in technical writing and creative writing and how open source documentation can interact with that!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what GitHub is and how it works!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need bodies to do extremely simple tasks.
- 📫 How to reach me ...I don't know yet!
